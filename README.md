# Project-Euler
My Project Euler solutions so far. Using this to better learn python and problem solving with programming.

If someone randomly sees this and thinks I could have done something in a better (or cooler) way, I'd really appreciate any feedback.

I'm looking at other people's code when I solve each problem to see better ways to do things too.
